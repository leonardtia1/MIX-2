## About the Video Course
Infrastructure as Code delivers stable, quick, reliable and reproducible environments at scale. Terraform is being increasingly used by Cloud Engineers to automate provisioning of infrastructure across all major infrastructure providers. It treats all infrastructure as code which can be edited, shared, version controlled and reused across teams.
This course will use Terraform to reduce time and effort with provisioning infrastructure. You will write infrastructure code to create, change, import and destroy resources. By following the best practices of Infrastructure as Code you will quickly get started on your own deployments.
By the end of this course, you will be able to create and maintain complex infrastructure configurations
